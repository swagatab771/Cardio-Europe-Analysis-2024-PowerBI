This script forecasts mortality rates for a given future year based on historical data. It reads a CSV file containing mortality rates grouped by country, disease, and gender. For each group, if there are at least three years of data, it uses Facebook Prophet, a time series forecasting model, to predict the rate for the target year. If there are fewer data points, it falls back to an ARIMA model, which works better with limited data. The script then saves both the forecasted results and a combined file that includes the original data plus the new predictions. The whole process is wrapped in a reusable function and a main method for easy execution.
